Grid is a containerist landingpage editor.

== Description ==

What is Grid?

* Grid allows Editors to easily create and maintain Landingpages
* Grid is build of a grid containing Containers and Boxes
* Grid is a CMS-neutral Library and this is the Wordpress plugin that implements it

Types of Boxes

- Static Boxes -

* Free-HTML-Box
* Medialibrary-Box
* Video-Box

- List-Boxes -

* Ordered and filtered Lists of Contents
* Number of Items as well as criteria for sorting and filtering are configurable

- Content-Boxes -

* Single Posts of any kind as Teasers

- Reuseable Boxes -

* All Boxes may be reused across several Landingpages

Easy extendable with new boxes. Have a look at doc.the-grid.ws (english is coming soon).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `grid-wordpress.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Extract the Plugin to a `grid` Folder
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Build landing pages at `Landing Pages`, `Switch into the Grid` and on next screen `save changes`
1. Look for more plugins on wordpress.org that can provide grid boxes

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do the async features like author control work? Does Grid talk to an external service? =

Generally speaking, yes! But you can easily turn it off in grid settings. And there will be no talking to any external server anymore. Alternatively you can host your own grid async service on your own server. Note that our service will not use or save any personal data at any time. It only uses data to keep the function going.

= Table already exists error when I want to activate Grid. Why? = 

This happens if grid was installed previously and could not be uninstalled correctly. You have to delete in the wp_options the option_name „grid“. Then try again to active Grid plugin.

= How do I use Grid landingpages? =

Goto Settings->Grid and choose which post types should be able to use Grid. Than goto one of the activated post types and click on `Switch into the Grid` and on next screen `save changes`. Now you can drag and drop your landingpage.

= How do I get new box types? =

Have a look at wordpress.org for plugins that provide new grid boxes or you can create your own plugin and use the `grid_load_classes` action to add new box classes. You can find a documentation at doc.the-grid.ws
